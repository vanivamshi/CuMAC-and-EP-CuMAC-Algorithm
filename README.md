# CuMAC and EP-CuMAC
The folder contains the python programs for CuMAC and EP-CuMAC algorithms. There are two server programs and one client program under each of them. The server programs vary slightly based on the packet verification methid, i.e., real-time and full (non-real-time) authentication. Both the server programs are programed to run on the same client program. Hence, only one client program suffices both the authentication methods.
