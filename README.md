# CuMAC Algorithm
The folder contains the python programs for CuMAC algorithms. There are two server programs and one client program under each of them. The server programs vary slightly based on the packet verification methid, i.e., real-time and full (non-real-time) authentication. Both the server programs are programed to run on the same client program. Hence, only one client program suffices both the authentication methods.

Developed as a part of my Ph.D. research based on the original CuMAC paper, accessible at - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162217
